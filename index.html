Surveys may be conducted by phone, mail, via the internet, and also at street corners or in malls. Surveys are used to gather or gain knowledge in fields such as social research and demography.</p><p class="para">Survey research is often used to assess thoughts, opinions and feelings.[1] Surveys can be specific and limited, or they can have more global, widespread goals.
